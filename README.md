# sct [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bzumhagen/sct.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bzumhagen/sct) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/bzumhagen/sct/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/bzumhagen/sct?branch=master)
This repository houses the source code for sct, the simple changelog tool. It's a tool which allows a changelog to be generated based on version control system commits. We already should be writing good commit messages, so why not go a little farther, write commit messages a little better, and then automatically generate a changelog on demand.

Currently sct only supports projects which are using git and semantic versioning.

## Getting Started

Currently there are two main ways you can use sct.

1. Via build tool plugin - This is the recommended way to use sct. See https://github.com/bzumhagen/sbt-sct for a plugin for sbt. Maven plugin not currently available.
